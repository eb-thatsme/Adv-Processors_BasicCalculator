# Adv-Processors_BasicCalculator
Using MIPS Assembly, this program is capable of evaluating a mathematical expression taken from user input and displaying the result in the I/O window. The expression can have a maximum of 4 operators, and each operand can have a maximum of 4 digits. The expression is checked for validity before evaluation, and the code is capable of evaluating expressions continously without the need for re-assembly.   

This project was a collaborative effort between myself and 3 classmates.
